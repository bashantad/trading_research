-            Javascript  Sample for Alexa Web Information Service             -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This sample will make a request to the Alexa Web Information Service
using the API user credentials and API plan key.

Tested with Node v8.11.2

1. Subscribe to the Alexa Web Information Service at https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace.
   (Note that you must have an AWS account with a valid credit card.)
2. Register or login to the Alexa Developer Portal and copy the API Key shown on the page.
3. Uncompress the zip file into a working directory.
4. Compile project:

npm install

5. Run:

node urlinfo.js <USER> <API_KEY> <SITE>

If you are getting "Not Authorized" messages, you probably have one of the
following problems:

1. Your API registration might not be complete. Return to the AWS Marketplace listing
page and confirm you are subscribed to the product.

2. If you are getting "Request Expired" messages, please check that the date
and time are properly set on your computer.
